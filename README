Zero is an early operating system project. Zero consists of a somewhat
functional kernel framework, a partially-implemented C standard library
(mostly C99 with things from C11 being planned), a couple of in-progress
support libraries, and some (too little at the moment) documentation for
different parts of the project.

I hereby invite you to take a look at another project I'm keen on,

Thanks for your interest,

P.S. If you should donate, feel free to ask me about books I need; I would blow
the donations on things such as proper FPGA-gear to experiment with hardware.
I have been hacking together an instruction set and I'm likely to create a new
processor.
