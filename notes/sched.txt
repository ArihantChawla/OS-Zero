Zero Thread Scheduler
---------------------
- interval tasks for operations such as multimedia buffer synchronisation
  - HPET timer (X86)
    - 1 millisecond time slices for purposes such as handling user input events
- try to guarantee non-skipping multimedia without frame-dropping
- use 4 millisecond time slices

Thread Priorities
-----------------
- fixed realtime priority for certain system tasks
  - audio synchronisation
  - video synchronisation
  - user input
- deadline requirements
- interactive threads
- batch threads
- the idle thread

- kernel HZ is 250 [timer interrupts per second]
- give high priority to short-lived low-latency tasks
  - audio buffer synchronisation	10 Hz
  - screen buffer synchronisation	125 Hz
  - keyboard input			25 Hz
  - mouse input				50 Hz
- give high interactive priority to newly created threads
- adjust priority within class with increment, wrap around to zero at maximum
- TODO: class transitions
  - keyboard and mouse input	- interactive class
  - I/O on non-HID descriptors	- batch class
