Cyber War
---------

Cyber War shall be a programming game. We will have a virtual machine with a
simple instruction set as well as possibly code generation and other programming
tools for it.

CW Machine Environment
----------------------

Machine Status Word
-------------------
- ZF	- zero flag
- CF	- carry flag
- SF	- sign flag

Registers
---------

- 8 64-bit general purpose registers, including stack and frame pointers
  - ra (eax), rb (ebx), rc (ecx), rd (edx), re (edi), rf (esi)
  - rsp (esp), rfp (ebp)

Instruction Format
------------------

- allow for 8-bit immediate values, otherwise use additional 32-bit words

0..7	- opcode (8-bit)
8..15	- operation source and destination register IDs
16..31	- operation flags
32..63	- max 32-bit immediate operand in LSB byte order

CW Instruction Set
------------------

Logical Operations
------------------

and	- logical AND of two operands
or	- logical OR of two operands
xor	- logical exclusive OR of two operands
compl	- take 2's complement (negate bits)

Arithmetic Operations
---------------------

inc	- increment operand by one
dec	- decrement operand by one
add	- add two operands
sub	- subtract one operand from another
mul	- multiply two operands
shl	- shift operand left
shr	- shift operand right, arithmetic (fill with sign)
shrl	- shift operand right, logical (fill with zero)
div	- divide operand by another
mod	- modulus

Memory Operations
-----------------

mov	- move data between registers and memory

Branch Instructions
-------------------

bz	- branch if zero
bg	- branch if greater than
bge	- branch if greater than or equal
bl	- branch if less than
ble	- branch if less than or equal to
jmp	- branch unconditionally

Miscellaneous Instructions
--------------------------

ret	- return from subroutine
wpt	- write process terminate

Memory References
-----------------

immediate		- $i - constant values; 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit
indexed			- reg0[$i] - allow using program counter as base;
indexed indirect	- reg0[reg1]
indexed indirect scaled	- reg0[reg1, f] - f is shift count
