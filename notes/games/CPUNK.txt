This directory currently contains ideas for a cyberpunk-themed room exploration
game. I think we could do a rogue-like with cyberpunk-twists such as program on
program combat mode. People could develop their programs in a C-like interface.
The game would not be violent, instead the only physical combat would be martial
arts.
