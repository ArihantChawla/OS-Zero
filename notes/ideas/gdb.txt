Ideas for a Graphical GDB Frontend
----------------------------------

- show contents of registers and the variables they are mapped to
- show some code surrounding the instruction pointer disassembled (symbol-map?)
- show hardware context (GDT segments, IDT entries, page directory and page
  tables, etc.)
- show I/O permission bitmaps
- visualise things to analyse code behavior
