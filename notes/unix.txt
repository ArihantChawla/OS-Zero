notes on Unix-like operating systems
------------------------------------

Unix-likes are typically relatively simple (to a point :P) systems.

system environment
------------------

processor execution levels
--------------------------

the operations below are listed starting from the highest priority.

- machine errors
- clock
- disk devices
- network devices
- terminals
- software interrupts

a process can have exactly one of these states at any given moment.

- being created (TASK_CREATE)
- executing in user mode (TASK_USER)
- executing in kernel mode (TASK_KERNEL)
- not executing, but ready to run (TASK_READY)
- waiting/sleeping (TASK_WAIT)
- stopped (TASK_STOP)
- zombie (TASK_ZOMBIE); terminated, but exit status hasn't been fetched yet
