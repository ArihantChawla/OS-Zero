Zero Storage Management
-----------------------
- the following is a list of storage device types in a sort expected speed order
  (slowest first)

type	brief			seek
----	-----			----
fd	floppy drive		random, slow
rt	rewindable tape		rewind, very slow
mo	magneto-optical drive	randow, slow
od	optical drive		random, slow
hd	hard drive 		random, relatively slow
mc	memory card		random, fast
ssd	solid state drive	random, very fast

techniques
----------
- seek-wait
  - wait a given time before seek
    - favor sequential operations
- read-ahead
  - read the next few blocks predictively
  - reduce number of read operations
- buf-nosave
  - avoid saving buffers unlikely to be processed again
- synchronous I/O

operation attributes
--------------------
- optical burn
  - sequential writes
  - buf-nosave
- multimedia playback
  - sequential reads
  - read-ahead
  - buf-nosave
