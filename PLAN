Zero Project Plans and Ideas
----------------------------

Goals
-----

- design and implement a model kernel for multicore and multiprocessor systems
- support POSIX System Interface in library-level; make the kernel support
  necessary features for POSIX
- possible compatibility with Linux- and *BSD-binaries later
  - support 'system personalities'
- high performance for multimedia playback and production including games
  - the vast majority of the OS so far is implemented in ISO C
  - mostly just the required parts in assembly; some SIMD-optimisations
- support for X86-, X86-64-, and ARM-architectures
  - alloca(), setjmp(), and longjmp() exist for all of these already
  - mutexes and some other machine operations implemented for all three
    architectures

Documentation
-------------
- an early book idea for the kernel project (zerovol1.tex + zerovol1.pdf)
- another early book on assembly programming with WPM (see below)
- my book draft on low-level programming (wizardcode4.pdf)

Software
--------

WPM
---
- Wizard Pseudo Machine; a simple RISC-like virtual architecture
  - currently 32-bit
  - instruction set
  - bytecode interpreter
  - assembly translation with ZAS
  - virtual memory simulated with standard malloc() and friends
  - THR; an instruction to launch new threads of execution
  - load-store architecture; only a few instructions operate on memory operands
    - MOV
    - stack; PUSH and POP
  - linker/loader-functionality to be added for pretranslated binaries
  - an early assembly manual (wpmprog.tex and wpmprog.pdf)

ZAS
---
- Zero Assembler; a simple AT&T-syntax assembler for WPM and ZPC
  - ZPC-support in progress; make ZAS retargetable

ZPC
---
- Zero Programmer's Calculator; a programmer's calculator with most C operations
  as well as some typical machine operations such as bitwise rotates
  - support for assembly-programmability in progress
    - custom instruction set
  - could support other programming languages such as Forth

Software to Be Ported
---------------------

- Enlightenment Foundation Libraries
- Mesa
- Quake
- ScummVM
- SDL
- Wayland

Games
-----
- there is currently some ideas and code under usr/games/ in the GIT repository
  - dice; simple code to 'roll dice'
  - cwar; a program-on-program combat game
    - most likely a Core Wars 'machine' for Redcode
  - cpunk
    - cyberpunk-themed rogue-like room/world exploring game
  - czone
    - real-time strategy game with programmable troops/units
  - y2k
    - early ideas for some kind of an adventure game
