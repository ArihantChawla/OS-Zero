The purpose of this file is to eventually describe a couple of different virtual
machines, their implementation as well as some essential utilities for them such
as the small and simple zas assembler.

One of the virtual machines to be described in this paper is my implementation
of the game of Core War(s). I also plan to describe Zero Virtual Machine (zvm),
which is a simple RISC-like virtual architecture with an AT&T syntax assembler
as well as a bytecode interpreter ("virtual machine").
