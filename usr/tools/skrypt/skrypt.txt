Skrypt Terminal Scripting Language
----------------------------------

Skrypt aims to provide a compiler for a simple scripting language used to
control drawing of text on terminal emulators and system consoles. This is done
by translating code into escape sequences.

The plan is to support modem rate emulation to draw existing ANSI and ASCII art
the way it was intended.
