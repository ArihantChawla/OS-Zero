Notes on Cray-1 Machine Architecture
------------------------------------

Based on the book CRAY-1 Computer Systems Hardware Reference Manual.

Computation Section
-------------------

- registers
- functional units
- instruction buffers

- 64-bit words
- 12.5-nanosecond clock period
- 2's complement arithmetic
- scalar and vector processing modes
- twelve fully segmented functional units
- 8 24-bit address (A) registers
- 64 24-bit intermediate address (B) registers
- 8 64-bit scalar (S) registers
- 64 64-bit intermediate scalar (T) registers
- 8 64-element vector (V) registers, 64 bits per element
- 4 instruction buffers of 64 16-bit parcels each
- integer and floating point arithmetic
- 128 instruction codes; executed as 16-bit (one parcel) or 32-bit (two parcels)
  instructions
- floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and reciprocal
  approximation used for division
- integer or fixed point addition, subtraction, multiplication
  - multiplication produces a 24-bit result
  - addition and subtracion produce either 24- or 64-bit results
  - no integer divide; accomplished through software algorithm using floating
    point hardware
- boolean operations OR, AND, XOR, and mask-controlled merge
- shift operations allow the manipulation of 64-bit or 128-bit operands to
  produce 64-bit results
- all but 24-bit integer arithmetic operations are implemented in both vector
  and scalar instructions
- integer product is a scalar instruction designed for index calculation
- full indexing capability allows the programmer to index throughout the memory
  in eithe scalar or vector modes
  - index may be positive or negative in either mode
  - allows matrix operations in vector mode to be performed on rows or the
    diagonal as well as conventional colum-oriented operations

- maximum transfer rate for B, T, and V registers is one word per clock period
- for A and S registers, transfer rate is one word per two clock periods

Memory Section
--------------

- 0.25 - 1 M 64-bit bi-polar words

- up to 1 M words of bi-polar memory
  (64 data bits and eight error correction bits)
- 8 or 16 banks
- four-clock-period bank cycle time
- one word per clock period transfer rate to B, T, and V registers
- one word per two clock periods transfer rate for A and S registers
- four words per clock period transfer rate to instruction buffers
- single error correction; double error detection (SECDED)

- memory cycle time is four clock periods (50 ns)
- time required to fetch from memory to scalar register is 11 clock periods

I/O Section
-----------

- 12 input channels
- 12 output channels
- MCU; maintenance control unit
- mass storage
- front-end computers
- I/O stations
- peripheral equipment

- channel groups contation either six input or six output channels
- channel groups served equally by memory (scanned every four clock periods)
- channel priority resolved within channel groups
- 16 data bits, 3 control bits per channel, 4 parity bits, external master clear
- lost data detection

- 12 full duplex 16-bit channels
  - control lines; presence of data (ready), data received (resume), transfer
    complete (disconnect)
- 4 channel groups
  - a group is 6 input or output paths
- groups are scanned sequentially for I/O, one channel per clock period
- channel group will be reinterrogated four clock periods later whether any
  I/O request is pending or not
- if omre than one channel of the channel group is active, requests are resolved
  on a priority basis; lowest-numbered channel is serviced first

Register Designators
--------------------

- A, B, S, T, and V registers; Cray X-MP adds SB, ST, and SM
  - support registers
    - Cray-1
      - CA	- current address
      - CL	- channel limit
      - CI	- channel interrupt flag
      - CE	- channel error flag
      - RT	- real-time clock
      - SB	- sign bit (Sk, with k=0)
      - VL	- vector length
      - XA	- exchange address
    - Cray X-MP only
      - VM	- vector mask
      - MC	- master clear
      - SM	- semaphore

Location Field
--------------

- optional location symbol
  - when present, it's got a parcel address as indicated by location counter
    after forced to parcel boundary
