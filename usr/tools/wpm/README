This directory tree contains Wizard Pseudo Machine, a simple machine simulator
for a custom instruction set - basically, an assembler and a bytecode
interpreter.

Building WPM
------------

Execute the build script

	./build.sh

in the wpm directory.

Testing WPM
------------

WPM currently translates assembly code at runtime. For example, to test our
hello world program, execute

      ./wpm 5.asm

in the wpm directory.
