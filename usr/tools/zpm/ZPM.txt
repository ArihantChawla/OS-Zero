Zero Pseudo Machine
-------------------

Zero Pseudo Machine, later called ZPM for short, aims to be a simple virtual
machine designed and implemented with education in mind; teaching and learning
programming is a vital thing today.

I wanted to create a RISC-like architecture with an instruction set closely
resembling the C programming language; the "machine" will first be programmable
in its own assembly dialect (AT&T syntax), but I hope to extend it with
languages such as Basic, Forth, and possibly a subset/version of C.
