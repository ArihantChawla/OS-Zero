Zvm is a project to develop a virtual machine also useful as a programmer's
calculator. I plan on attempting to do ports for at least Symbian OS Series 60
phones such as my newly-acquired Nokia E90 Communicator as well as 32-bit and
64-bit X86 architectures.

As a development project, the source code is often the best place to look for
documentation, although other documentation is planned too.
