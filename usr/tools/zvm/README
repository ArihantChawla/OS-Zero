Zero Virtual Machine
--------------------

Zero Virtual Machine, zvm from now on, is a project aimed to implement a
virtual architecture. Currently, this consists of a custom RISC-like
instruction set, a small assembler called zas, and an early implementation
of a bytecode interpreter/translator.

Support is being planned for flexible I/O using ports such as STDIN, STDOUT,
and STDERR.

Graphics support will most likely be implemented using Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries (EFL). I will attempt to program the basic GUI in Edje and interface
with Elementary for widgets.
