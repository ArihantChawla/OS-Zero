Earthquake C Environment Ideas
------------------------------

Here are some ideas for Earthquake. I will try to list the functions for the
different parts in the order they would be typically invoked in a C
preprocessor, assembler, and C compiler.

In case you're running a computer hardware company or something close enough
and are able to utilize these ideas for software development systems, I
wouldn't turn down hardware donations for working on my projects. :) It would
rock to port some of my software to different architectures. One thing I'm
really interested in would be to develop a base software system for the Micro-
soft Xbox console. It's basically x86-hardware, I just need to get the exact
hardware manuals and possibly a console and some C development utilities + a
kernel for it to develop projects on.

Assembler
---------

This is my first idea of implementing an assembler library for Lightning.

- Eassemble(source, target)	- generate assembly from preprocessed C code.
- Egencode(code, target)	- generate machine code from assembly.
- Eoptasm(asm, flags)		- run code optimizer on assembly code.

Code Optimiser
--------------

This is my first idea for implementing a C code optimiser

- Eoptswitch()		- optimize switch statement; use jump table if possible
- Eoptifelse()		- optimize if-else statement for when we cannot guess
  			  the maximum value for jump table size.
- Eoptloop()		- optimize for, do-while, and while loops.
- Epeephole()		- peephole optimizations; use whole functions as peep-
			  holes to eliminate common expressions.
