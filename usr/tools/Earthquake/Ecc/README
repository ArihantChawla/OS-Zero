This is the root directory for the Lightning Experimental C Compiler. First,
I would have called it simply Lightning C Compiler (lcc), but there's already a
compiler called lcc so I had to think of something else. I wasn't annoying
enough to call it, say, Vendu's C Compiler. >:)

Lecc was started as a rewrite and librarization of Fabrice Bellard's Tiny C
Compiler (TCC). Greetings Fabrice, I need to find a way to harness you into
the Lightning project. ;)
