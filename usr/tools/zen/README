Zen is a simple, virtual machine based programming environment for the Zero
operating system. Zen is based more or less loosely on project such as BPF
(Berkeley Packet Filters) and its successor eBPF.

In addition to filtering/firewalling network traffic packets, the plan is to
extend Zen for other tasks such as analyzing use of system resources in Zero;
I'm planning to see about creating a set of tools to test, debug, and possibly
profile parts of my operating system and other projects.

Any and all kinds of suggestions and ideas for Zen would be welcome. :)
