Mjolnir
-------

This document contains ideas for a Rogue-like adventure game.

Introduction
------------

Legend has it that many moons ago, Fenris, the eldest child of Loki and
Angrboda, broke free from his chain, Pleignir, and stole Mjolnir from Thor.
Fenris is believed to have hidden Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, into a dungeon.

It is said that Thor shall ascend the one to return Mjolnir to a deity for
saving the world from the forces of evil creating chaos with lightnings and
thunder. Clairvoyants say evil forces are already on the hunt for Mjolnir.

Armed with nothing more than a few food ratios, your pet dog or cat, a +1
blessed armor, a +3 neutral sword, and a piece of Pleignir, you enter the
Dungeon. Good luck, adventurer, and beware of Fenris!

Characters
----------

To make the most fun off the game and keep it playable on old terminals too,
the standard "graphics" are drawn as characters.
