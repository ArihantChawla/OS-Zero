corewar
-------
- usr/games/corewar has a simple instruction set implemented for the
  programming game Core War
  - see usr/games/corewar/README for more information

mjolnir
-------
- the rogue-like is an undergoing design
  - a set of objects and creatures is documented
  - BSP-table is used for dungeon generation, but it hasn't been tested
    yet because there is no graphical or text interface implemented (yet ;))
  - the dungeon crawler's plot will have references to Norse and other
    mythologies
  - most of the current ideas for the game are listed in mjolnir/IDEAS.txt
- core war might be used as a sub-game in mjolnir
