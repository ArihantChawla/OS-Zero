Dungeon
-------

This document contains ideas for a Rogue-like adventure game.

The Game
--------

The goal in the game is to recover Mjölnir, aka the "hammer" (really a dual-side
axe) of Thor from deep underground to keep the forces of evil from creating
chaos with thunder and lightnings.

Characters
----------

To make the most fun off the game and keep it playable on old terminals too,
the standard "graphics" are drawn as characters.
