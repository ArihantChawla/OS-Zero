Roadmap for libzero
-------------------

Tested Modules
--------------

Following is a list of modules that have been tested and should work, if not
totally correctly, at least "well enough..."

Module		Notes
------		-----
asm		per-platform assembly routines
cdefs		macros to mask out differences between compilers
daemon		routine to daemonize a process on unix
fastudiv	replace 16-bit integer division by faster ops on 32-bit words
hash		reusable hash tables + a nice bunch of hash functions
ip4		internet protocol v4 checksum routines
mtx		different mutexes (binary semaphores)
nopack, pack	pack-attribute management for some compilers
priolk		locklessinc priority locks
prof		microsecond and clock cycle counters
randmt32	32-bit mersenne twister pseudo-random number generator
randmt64	64-bit mersenne twister pseudo-random number generator
spin		spinlocks
tktlk		locklessinc ticket locks
trix		different bit-magic and such optimisatoin tricks (most tested)
unix		some system routines for unix-likes
