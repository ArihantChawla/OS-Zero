# Zero Support Library libzero

Zero is a multi-purpose utility library for both the Zero kernel as well as our
user-land applications. Support has been worked on for several different pseudo-
random number generators, some "generic" data structures such as linked lists
and hash tables, exposing compiler and system features such as alignment,
packing of aggregates, page and cacheline sizes, and so forth.

As a collection of loosely-related and even unrelated pieces of software, Zero
is hard to describe in a few words. Look around in the source code to get a
better picture of what I have implemented so far. :)
