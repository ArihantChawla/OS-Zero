This library contains a mathematics library based on code and documentation
from myself, The Open Group, MIT, FreeBSD, IBM, most likely Sun Microsystems,
AT&T, Microsoft Corporation and possibly other parties.

FPUs are utilised in assembly where necessary, SIMD support is being implemented
for x86-architectures, the library aims to implement a mathematics interface
based on vectors of data-parallel memory and so forth.

I want to extend personal thanks to everyone whose code and documentation I have
had the wonderful chance to study. :)

P.S. I will write an AUTHORS file soon ;)
