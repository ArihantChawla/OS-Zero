This library contains a mathematics library based on code from myself, MIT,
FreeBSD, IBM, most likely Sun Microsystems, Microsoft corporation.

FPUs are utilised in assembly where necessary, SIMD support is essential,
the library aims to implement a mathematics interface based on vectors of
data-parallel memory.

I want to extend personal thanks to everyone whose code I have had the wonderful
chance to study. :)
