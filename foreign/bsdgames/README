This directory exists for fetching the BSD Games package from github and
building it.

./build.sh, when executed, will try to check if you're on Linux or another
system and fetch the Linux or BSD version of the package accordingly.

The Linux configure script will ask you for certain directories, file owners,
permissions and such. It's highly recommended that you use /usr/local instead
of toplevel directories such as /etc, /var, and /usr/* not to mess up your
distribution configuration.

For my answers for the Linux build system, see the file LINUX.txt.
