build
-----

NOTE: you need a 32-bit build of GRUB 2 to successfully build a bootable CD-ROM
image. There is a convenience script to build a local copy of GRUB2 within the
Zero tree:

./mkgrub.sh

To build a CD-ROM image (cd.iso), do the following:

1. ./mkcdimg2.sh

test
----
- execute qemu.sh (later qemusmp.sh too)

debug
-----
1. execute qemudebug.sh
2. gdb -x gdbscript
