This list is by no means complete, but I'll try to list at least the biggest
issues in the kernel code base here.

- [32-bit] SMP bootstrap code is broken
- a lot of stuff is untested; I will try to comment such code better
- building of bootable CD-ROM images (kern/unit/ia32/mkcdimg.sh) is broken;
  grub-mkrescue used to work, but something has changed Somewhere (TM) after
  that (may be my fault, too)
