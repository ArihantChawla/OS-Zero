- the basic kernel boots on IA-32
  - hasn't been tested on real hardware yet
- timer interrupts tick at 250 Hz in the default configuration
  - the macro HZ is declared in <kern/conf.h>
- interrupt handlers are installed for signal disposition, page faults,
  and some other system functionality
- system call interface is in design phase; see 
- virtual memory is mapped to physical on-demand
  - there is no disk drivers or real page-replacement for paging yet
- PS/2 keyboard and mouse drivers have been partially implemented
- PCI bus driver is under development
- timer interrupts should work using either the PIT or local APICs
