zero kernel ideas
-----------------

user input
----------
- keyboard passes scan-codes as 64-bit integers
- mouse/pointer packets are 8-bit button ID + 24-bit X- and Y-coordinates
  (screen) + 8-bit Z coordinate (wheel)

scheduler
---------
- default time slice is 4 milliseconds
- minislice is 1 millisecond;
  - keyboard and mouse input processing (driven by interrupt handlers)

event interface
---------------

kernel events
-------------
- system
  - reboot/shutdown

- hardware
  - connect, disconnect

user events
-----------
- keyboard and pointer (e.g. mouse) events
- [virtual] file-system events
- audio and video events
- network events
- desktop events

IPC
---
- transport; mem, shm, buf, file, mq, net
  - mem
    - "regular" memory region stores data
  - shm
    - shared memory; may be mapped to same physical memory by both the kernel
      and users processes; single-process map as a special case without locks
  - buf
    - block I/O buffer cache relays data
  - intermediate file is used to pass/map data
  - mq
    - message queue; ID + priority
  - net
    - TCP/IP or another protocol set is used to carry network packets

virtual filesystem
------------------
- network transparent; implement NFS natively
- nodes
  - regular file, directory, named pipe (FIFO), message queue, socket
- I/O streams (analogous with files)
- I/O filters;
  - encryption
  - multimedia en- and decoding
    - images
    - audio streams and samples
    - video streams and stills/images
