acute things
------------
- make threads store context in their own kernel-mode stacks instead of the
  thread structure - YAY, i get to redo context switches :P
  - actually implement per-thread stacks (kernel- and user-mode kernel stacks)
- hack a bitmap to denote which pages are reserved for hardware access
  - initialise the kernel virtual memory allocator with this bitmap
- hack the keyboard driver to pass keysym-events for real =)
  - improve event interface
- implement ATA and SATA drivers
- implement ISO 9660 filesystem for CD and DVD discs
- implement [block] I/O buffer cache
- implement ELF linker/loader
- implement virtual filesystem (VFS)
- implement filesystems such as UFS2 and/or BeFS
- fix Soundblaster 16 and AC97 audio drivers... =)
- umap(struct sysmemreg *reg, long flg)
  - share kernel memory with user applications
future things
